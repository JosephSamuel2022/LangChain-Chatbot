# LangChain-Chatbot
This repository contains a simple Flask-based API that serves as a chatbot. The chatbot uses a library called "langchain" to handle the questions and provide answers based on the data stored in "data.txt". The API receives questions through HTTP POST requests and responds with relevant information from the data file. If the question is not relevant, it responds with a predefined message.

## Installation and Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install Flask flask-cors dotenv
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Usage
Make sure you have a "data.txt" file in the repository containing the relevant information that the chatbot will use to answer questions.

Start the Flask server by running the "app.py" script:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The API will now be running on http://localhost:5000.
API Endpoints
POST /api/chatbot: This endpoint receives questions in JSON format and responds with answers based on the information available in the "data.txt" file.
Example Usage
To ask a question to the chatbot, send a POST request with the question to the endpoint http://localhost:5000/api/chatbot. The question should be provided in JSON format, like this:

json
Copy code
{
    "question": "What is your name?"
}
About Langchain
Langchain appears to be a custom library used to handle document indexing and querying based on text data. The chatgpt.py script uses it to create an index of the data stored in "data.txt" and then queries that index to respond to user questions. The specific implementation details and features of Langchain are not provided in this repository, so for further information, you might need to refer to the official documentation or other resources about Langchain.

Please note that the code provided in chatgpt.py is relatively limited in functionality and may not be a complete representation of the full capabilities of the Langchain library.

Important Note
This code setup assumes that the Langchain library is already installed in the environment where the API runs. If Langchain is a custom library that you have developed yourself, make sure it is properly installed and available for use.

It's also worth mentioning that the use of subprocess.check_output to call an external Python script (chatgpt.py) might have some security implications, so it's essential to ensure that the input is well-sanitized to avoid any potential security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, this repository does not cover model training or the implementation of the "TextLoader" and "VectorstoreIndexCreator" classes, which seem to be crucial components of the Langchain library. As a result, without those classes and their definitions, the provided code will not function correctly.
